Originally developed in Eclipse, this sample project should be easy enough to set up.  See http://gleefultomatoes.blogspot.com/2014/05/a-simple-maven-project-with-sub-modules.html for more details.

You don't need Eclipse to run the examples.  Simple Maven calls should be sufficient.  Again, see my blog entry for more details.
